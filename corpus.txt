<HEAD>The Cat in the Hat</HEAD>
<TEXT>
The sun did not shine.
It was too wet to play.
So we sat in the house.
All that cold, cold, wet day.

I sat there with Sally.
We sat there, we two.
And I said, "How I wish 
We had something to do!"

Too wet to go out
And too cold to play ball.
So we sat in the house.
We did nothing at all.

So all we could do was to 
Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!
And we did not like it.
Not one little bit.

And then 
Something went BUMP!
How that bump made us jump!

We looked!
Then we saw him step in on the mat!
We looked!
And we saw him!
The Cat in the Hat!
And he said to us,
"Why do you sit there like that?"

"I know it is wet
And the sun is not sunny.
But we can have
Lots of good fun that is funny!"

"I know some good games we could play,"
Said the cat.
"I know some new tricks,"
Said the Cat in the Hat.
"A lot of good tricks.
I will show them to you.
Your mother
Will not mind at all if I do."

Then Sally and I 
Did not know what to say.
Our mother was out of the house
For the day.

From there to here,
from here to there,
funny things
are everywhere.

One fish
two fish 
red fish 
blue fish

Black fish 
blue fish
old fish 
new fish

This one has a little star.

This one has a little car.
Say! what a lot of fish there are.

Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.
Some are old. And some are new.

Some are sad.
And some are glad.

From there to here,
from here to there, 
funny things
are everywhere.

Here are some
who like to run.
They run for fun
in the hot, hot sun.
