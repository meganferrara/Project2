What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
	For me (Megan) the most challenging part of this assignment was figuring out where to start.
	I also had trouble figuring out the PostingsList not method but once I understood it was supposed to do it was fine.
	I also had trouble understanding the index class and didn't have enough time to work on it and understand it due to miscommunication and
	some incompleted methods I had to make up for.
	
How long did it take you?
	For me (Megan) it took me 15+ hours to get up to the point I did in the assignment.
	
When did you start?
	Thursday 2/15/18 since I was working on HW3 and the research paper summary before diving into the project.
	
We used a hashtable for implementing the mapping from terms to postings list. Using lowercasing,
 how many empty entries are there in the hashtable after you read in the index? Roughly how much 
 wasted memory does this correspond to?
 	(Megan) Since I didn't get to implement the index class fully I would have to take an educated guess that
 	there were many empty entries since from my understanding we remove duplicated terms and save their index 
 	into a postings list.
